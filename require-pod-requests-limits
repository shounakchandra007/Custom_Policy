    policies.kyverno.io/description: "As application workloads share cluster resources,\
      \ it is important to limit resources  requested and consumed by each pod. It\
      \ is recommended to require 'resources.requests'  and 'resources.limits' per\
      \ pod. If a namespace level request or limit is specified,  defaults will automatically\
      \ be applied to each pod based on the 'LimitRange'  configuration."
